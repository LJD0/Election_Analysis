## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be easily customized to analyze the results of different elections. By updating the input file to point to the specific election data file, the script can be used to assess results from various sources.

Additionally, the script can be expanded to include additional analyses based on specific needs. For example, it can incorporate data on eligible voter population to calculate the voter turnout rate, or explore voting patterns by demographics or precincts.

By utilizing the script's flexibility and adaptability, election commissions can efficiently evaluate election outcomes and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
